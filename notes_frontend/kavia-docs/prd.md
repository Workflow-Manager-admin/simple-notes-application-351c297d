# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Notes Frontend React App

## 1. Product Overview

The Notes Frontend React App is a lightweight, client-side application designed for effortless note-taking, organization, and retrieval. The app aims to provide users with a fast, distraction-free experience with a modern visual style, allowing easy creation, viewing, editing, deletion, and searching of notes. All data is stored in the user's browser via local storage, enabling persistence without the need for backend infrastructure. The application is suitable for personal productivity use cases such as jotting down ideas, to-do lists, or short drafts, and is optimized for both desktop and mobile web use.

## 2. Goals & Objectives

- **Provide a simple, intuitive interface** for managing notes with minimal learning curve.
- **Ensure user notes are reliably persisted** in the browser, surviving reloads and browser restarts.
- **Enable rapid note creation and search**, supporting efficient workflows for frequent note-takers.
- **Maintain high performance** and fast load times by avoiding heavy libraries or server dependencies.
- **Deliver a visually appealing, modern UI** that feels polished and professional.
- **Support usability in offline scenarios** by ensuring that all features work without an Internet connection.

## 3. User Stories

- **As a user,** I want to create a new note with a single click, so I can quickly jot down ideas.
- **As a user,** I want to see a list of all my notes in a sidebar, and select any to view or edit.
- **As a user,** I want to edit the content and title of any note, so I can update my information as needed.
- **As a user,** I want to delete notes I no longer need, to keep my workspace organized.
- **As a user,** I want to search my notes by keyword, to instantly find relevant information.
- **As a user,** I want my notes to be saved automatically in my browser, so I never lose them if I close or reload the app.
- **As a user,** I want an uncluttered, visually pleasing interface that adapts to my device, so I can use it comfortably on desktop or mobile.

## 4. Core Features

### 4.1 Create Note
- Users can create a new note by clicking the '+ New' button in the top navigation.
- The newly created note is added to the top of the note list and becomes the active note for editing.

### 4.2 Edit Note
- Users can edit both the title and the body content of a selected note.
- Edits are automatically saved to local storage as changes are made (no explicit 'Save' button required).
- The last edited timestamp for each note is displayed and updated upon changes.

### 4.3 Delete Note
- Users can delete the currently selected note from the editor.
- Upon deletion, the sidebar and editor update to reflect the next available note or an empty state if no notes remain.

### 4.4 View Notes
- All existing notes are displayed in a scrollable sidebar, ordered by creation or last edited time.
- Selecting a note brings its contents into the editor for immediate viewing or editing.

### 4.5 Search Notes
- Users can filter the list of notes with a search box in the sidebar.
- Filtering works for both note titles and body content and updates results in real time as the user types.

### 4.6 Data Persistence (Local Storage)
- All notes are stored as a JSON-encoded array in the browser's localStorage under the key "notes".
- Notes persist across browser reloads, tab closures, and restarts.
- No user authentication or server syncing; all data is local to the device and browser used.

## 5. UI/UX Requirements

### 5.1 Layout
- **Sidebar** (left): Lists notes and contains the search field. Collapses/hides on small screens (mobile).
- **Top Navigation Bar**: Stretches across the top, includes brand/title and '+ New' note button.
- **Main Editor Area**: Displays the selected note's title and body with edit and delete functionalities.

### 5.2 Theming & Style
- Uses a **light, modern theme** with subtle contrast for clarity and focus.
- Employs a color palette based on:
  - **Primary:** #1976d2 (blue)
  - **Secondary:** #424242 (dark gray)
  - **Accent:** #ffca28 (yellow)
- Layout and component styles reflect minimalism:
  - Rounded corners, soft shadows, and clean whitespace.
  - Distinct sections for sidebar, content, and navigation.
- CSS is implemented in `App.css` with variables for easy theme adjustments.

### 5.3 Responsiveness
- The app adapts fluidly from large desktops to small mobile screens:
  - Sidebar collapses or hides below certain width breakpoints.
  - Editor and navigation layouts adjust font size and padding appropriately.
- All controls are touch-friendly with accessible sizing.

### 5.4 Accessibility
- App navigation and controls are accessible via keyboard.
- Buttons, fields, and navigation elements include proper ARIA labels and focus states.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

### 6.1 Performance
- Initial load time should be minimal; app bundles and assets are less than 200KB uncompressed when possible.
- All note interactions (create, edit, search, delete) respond instantly, with UI feedback in less than 100ms.

### 6.2 Responsiveness
- Layout responds to changes in viewport size with no visible layout breaking.
- Sidebar remains usable and scrollable even with large numbers of notes.

### 6.3 Offline Capability
- All features—including note creation, editing, deletion, and search—function without an active network connection.
- No data loss occurs if the user closes or reloads the tab/app while offline.

### 6.4 Scalability
- Supports efficient operation with 100+ notes, with no noticeable slowdowns in searching, loading, or editing.

### 6.5 Security & Data Privacy
- No network requests for note data; all user information is kept strictly local and never leaves the browser.
- No user tracking or analytics implemented by default.

## 7. Success Criteria

- **Functional:** Users can create, view, search, edit, and delete notes with all changes persisting across browser reloads.
- **Reliability:** No accidental data loss during typical usage flows (except intentional note deletion).
- **Performance:** UI remains responsive even with a large set of notes (>100).
- **Usability:** New users can understand the UI and perform all major functions without needing documentation.
- **Visual Quality:** Interface meets standards for professional, modern web applications with consistent spacing, color, and font use.
- **Offline Support:** The app works identically whether the user is online or offline.
- **Accessibility:** All core workflows are accessible to users relying on keyboards and screen readers.
